  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Pizza Margherita is the simplest, most common form of pizza, with just the base, tomato sauce,
    and cheese topping. The name "Pizza Margherita" may be confusing, as in some places it refers to
    pizza with extra tomato slices on top of it, but here it simply refers to a plain pizza.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Base:</strong> Use a store-bought base or bake your own</li>
    <li><strong>Tomato sauce:</strong> Smooth tomato bolognese sauce works well for this if you
      don't want to make your own</li>
    <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Mozzarella is the classic pizza cheese, but you can also try
      others. Mozzarella and cheddar make a good mix.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the base</li>
    <li>Spread the sauce and cheese</li>
    <li>Bake</li>
  </ol>
