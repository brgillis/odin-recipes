Description
-----------

This is a learning project developed as part of The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com). The goal of this project is to put together all that I've learned about basic html, to develop a full mock website. The learning goals of this project are:

- Practice writing the basic html boilerplate so that I have it memorized
- Practice linking between pages on the website
- Practice setting up basic styling of pages
